			<h1>Me in a Nutshell</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Navin Kathawa, and I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I decided to major in computer science during my freshman year of college, when I took the mandatory programming course for engineers, and found that it was something that I very much enjoyed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have since gone on to take a variety of programming and computer science courses, and I have held two software engineering internships - one at Servant Systems, Inc. and the other at Billhighway. In addition to my coursework and work experience, I am on the executive board for Code-M, a computer science club on campus which, among other things, organizes programming workshops for those who are interested in learning more about programming and computer science. I am also a member of the club roller hockey team here at U of M.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a more personal level, I am an avid lover of both watching and playing hockey. I am a diehard fan of both the Detroit Red Wings and Washington Capitals, but I am a lover of the sport, so I'll watch no matter who is playing. I also enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, lifting weights, listening to rap and hip hop, and eating good food.
