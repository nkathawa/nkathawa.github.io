      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my site. Here, we talk all things personal finance. My name is Navin, and I am passionate about helping others reach their personal finance goals.
        I firmly believe that financial freedom can be attained through the implementation of simple principles. It requires work, dedication, and sacrifice, but is absolutely attainable.

      <p>
        In this blog, I will attempt to walk through various strategies, from budgeting to investing and everything in between. Half the battle is mental - overcoming mental hurdles,
        gaining new knowledge that can empower you to take control of your finances - these are the building blocks of sound personal finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no financial education - I am completely self-taught. I believe in everything that I write here, not just because it makes sense to me, but because I live it.
        I implement these strategies in my own life, and it has brought about a degree of financial peace I never thought was possible.
