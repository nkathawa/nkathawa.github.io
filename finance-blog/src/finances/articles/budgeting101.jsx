      I firmly believe that a budget is the foundation of good finances. I highly recommend starting any financial journey with a sound budget, as it provides the guardrails needed to gain positive momentum with your finances. Budgeting – and sticking to a budget in your spending – is more about switching your mentality rather than following strict guidelines. You first need to understand yourself and why you spend (and save) the way you do.  
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting from square one, a great approach is to track your spending first for a few months. By doing this, you are able to see exactly where your money is going. At the end of each month, organize your transactions into “buckets” – in other words, look at each transaction and decide to which category it belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Categories are largely personal, but there are some basic buckets anyone can probably begin with:
    </p>
    <div style={{display: 'flex',flexDirection: 'column',flexWrap: 'wrap',alignItems: 'center'}}>
      <img src="../budget_categories.png" alt="" style={{ width:'40%'}}/>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you don’t know where to start, this might be a good place to begin categorizing transactions. As you start to see the trends of your monthly spending, you can do two things: build your budget, and work to reduce your costs. By seeing your monthly costs for Dining/Entertainment are between $100 and $150 monthly, you can analyze your transactions and honestly decide if that is what you’d like to be spending. Only you can decide this. If you come to the conclusion that the spending is unnecessary, or you simply feel you are spending more than the joy that that category is bringing you, you can then work to reduce your spending and set a budget lower than your typical spend. In that case, you might try to set a hard cap of $100/month, and see how that goes for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, you will begin to see the trends in your spending, analyze each category, and set realistic budgets, until you have a budget built out that you can stick to. As you continue to review your monthly transactions, you might find new categories to add to the budget, such as clothing, travel, etc. You may also decide to break a bucket into multiple smaller buckets for better visibility. An example would be turning Transportation into Car Payment, Gas, Car Insurance, and Regular Maintenance. By doing this, you will improve your tracking and get greater visibility into how your money is working for you.

      To give an example of how to do this practically, we’ll work off a $50,000 salary. The concept of take-home pay is essentially whatever hits your bank account on a monthly basis (so less taxes, health insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plan savings, etc.). Let’s say that your take-home pay is then $3,000 monthly. Your budget with simple categories could look like this:
    </p>
    <div style={{display: 'flex',flexDirection: 'column',flexWrap: 'wrap',alignItems: 'center'}}>
      <img src="../budget_spend.png" alt="" style={{ width:'40%'}}/>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note this is just an example. Every situation is unique. If you live in a high cost of living area, your housing budget may need to be significantly higher. In that case, you would need to flex other areas. Perhaps you don’t need a car, as you live in New York City? That savings there could go to housing and the higher cost of groceries and restaurants in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how can one get started with budgeting? By following the above steps, over the course of a few months, you can get to a position of greater awareness. It’s only through awareness that we can make intentional decisions about our finances. For example, if you don’t know that your grocery bill as a single person is $600/month, how can you ever hope to reduce that? The key to understanding is visibility. Learn your patterns, and make conscious decisions to reduce (or maintain) your spending levels in different categories. Create new categories and break out larger buckets as you learn more and more. Track and scrutinize transactions and, in time, you’ll have your money working for you, rather than the other way around. And once you’re there, you can begin gaining control of your finances and build an emergency fund, save more for retirement and other goals, and generally build for the future.
